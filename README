Because why not?

gdp_per_capita_ppp.csv is a dump of:

life_expectancy_at_birth.csv is a dump of:
http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=phAwcNAVuyj2tPLxKvvnNPA

indicator_gapminder_population.csv is a dump of:
http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ

color_regions.csv is a dump of
http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=0AiggpTwMDcgocGhUNG13anZFdUdCdGRmMVplTzdfUFE&gid=1

(for csv from published Google Spreadsheets, append &output=csv to the URL)
