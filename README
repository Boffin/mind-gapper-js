Picking apart http://www.gapminder.org/world/ and rebuilding it in Javascript.

Because why not?

gdp_per_capita_ppp.csv is a dump of:
http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=phAwcNAVuyj1jiMAkmq1iMg

life_expectancy_at_birth.csv is a dump of:
http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=phAwcNAVuyj2tPLxKvvnNPA

(for csv from published Google Spreadsheets, append &output=csv to the URL)
